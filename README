This version of metis was modified by EDF for Code_Aster.
Original version of metis can be downloaded at http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/index.html.
Main difference with original version are:
- all int declaration have been changed into long in C sources (.c and .h);
- all scanf/printf formats have been chagned:  %d into %ld and %nd into %nld
  Exception for separator.c :
     IFSET(ctrl->dbglvl, DBG_SEPINFO,
     printf("Nvtxs: %6d, [%5d %5d], Cut: %6d, SS: [%6d %6d], Cover: %6d\n", nvtxs, graph->pwgts[0], graph->pwgts[1], graph->mincut, bnvtxs[0], bnvtxs[1]-bnvtxs[0], csize));
- struct.h ha been modified:
      #define MAXIDX (1<<8*sizeof(idxtype)-2)
  was modified into
      #define MAXIDX  (((idxtype)1)<<8*sizeof(idxtype)-2) 
- onmetis binary renamed onmetis.exe;
- created onmetis shell-script that runs 'onmetis.exe' in a temporary directory and accept output filename as 3rd argument;
- onmetis and onmetis.exe  accept '--version' argument to check the version level;
- this version doesn't build all binaries of the original one; it builds only pmetis, kmetis and onmetis.
